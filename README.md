# Encounter Manager
#### *A Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition Tool*
The goal of this project is to learn how to better work in a team by creating a useful tool for Dungeon Masters of the 4th edition version of Dungeons and Dragons. 

The first version functionality of the program may include:

- **Creating a new encounter**
- **Adding/removing ‘actors’ to/from the encounter**
- **Managing each ‘actors’ initiative and related dice rolls**
- **Round/turn tracking for each encounter**

Future versions of the program may include:

- **Managing effects that 'actors' acquire during the encounter**
- **User accounts**
- **Saving/Loading an encounter**
- **Save/Load 'actors'**
- **Implementation of more advanced DnD 4e rules such as surprise rounds**

## v0.1 Rules (DnD 4e Player's Handbook p. 266)
### The Combat Sequence
**Round:** In a round, every combatant takes a turn.

**Roll Initiative:** Everyone involved in a combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns. You roll Initiative only at the beginning of a combat encounter.

**Take Turns:** In initiative order, every combatant takes a turn, which includes various actions.

**Begin the next round:** When every combatant has had a turn, the round ends. Begin the next round with the combatant who has the highest initiative.

### Initiative
Throughout a battle, combatants act in order, from highest initiative result to lowest. The order in which combatants take their turns is called the initiative order. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

### Rolling Initiative
To determine a combat encounter's initiative order, roll initiative.
Roll 1d20 and add the following:

- One-half your level
- Your Dexterity modifier

When combatants have the same initiative, the combatant with the higher initiative bonus (the total of one-half your level, and your Dexterity modifier) goes before the other. If their bonuses are the same, they can roll a die or flip a coin to break the tie.
